# Synchronization

## Basic Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Directus Instance A
    participant Local as Local Files
    participant B as Directus Instance B

    Note over A: Make configurations
    A->>Local: pull
    Local->>B: push
    Note over A: Make more configurations
    A->>Local: pull
    Local-->>Local: diff
    Note right of Local: Compare changes
    Local->>B: push
```

## Pull

```shell
npx directus-sync pull
```

Retrieves the current schema and collections from Directus and stores them locally. This command does not modify the database.

It also retrieves the specifications (GraphQL & OpenAPI) and stores them locally. It gets specifications from the `/server/specs/*` endpoints:
- [OpenAPI](https://directus.io/docs/api/server#get-openapi-specification)
- [GraphQL SDL (Item & System scopes)](https://directus.io/docs/api/server#get-graphql-sdl)

**Available Options**

<HelpPull />

## Diff

```shell
npx directus-sync diff
```

Analyzes and describes the difference (diff) between your local schema and collections and the state of the Directus instance. This command is non-destructive and does not apply any changes to the database.

**Available Options**

<HelpDiff />

## Push

```shell
npx directus-sync push
```

Applies the changes from your local environment to the Directus instance. This command pushes your local schema and collection configurations to Directus, updating the instance to reflect your local state.

**Available Options**

<HelpPush />

## Common Options

### Collection Management

#### Include/Exclude Collections

Include only specific collections

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --only-collections roles,permissions
```

Exclude specific collections

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --exclude-collections settings
```

#### ID Preservation

Preserve IDs for specific collections

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --preserve-ids roles,panels
```

Preserve all possible IDs
```bash
npx directus-sync pull --preserve-ids all
```

### Schema Options

Skip schema operations

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --no-snapshot
```

Keep schema in single file

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --no-split
```

Skip API specs

```bash
npx directus-sync pull --no-specs
```

### Advanced Usage

Force diff even with version mismatch

```bash
npx directus-sync diff --force
```

#### Retry Configuration

Set maximum push retries.
Retries occur when a dependency between collections could not be resolved.

```bash
npx directus-sync push --max-push-retries 30
```

### Environment Variables

Instead of command-line options, you can use environment variables for authentication:

```bash
DIRECTUS_URL=https://directus.example.com
DIRECTUS_TOKEN=your-token
```

OR

```bash
DIRECTUS_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
DIRECTUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```
